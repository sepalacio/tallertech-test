/* Given an array of positive integers representing the values of coins in your possession,
write a function that returns the minimum amount of change (the  minimum sum of money)
that you  CANNOT create. The given coins can have any positive integer value and
aren't necessarily unique (i.e., you can have multiple coins of the same value). */
